## Project Overview

Welcome to our Predicting Member Class Attendance project! In this exciting data exploration adventure, we dive deep into the world of a dynamic sports club to predict whether members will attend their classes based on various attributes and factors.

### Key Features

- **Data Exploration:** Uncover hidden patterns and trends in our sports club dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Craft meaningful features that enhance prediction accuracy.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Employ state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to forecast attendance.
- **Actionable Insights:** Translate our findings into actionable recommendations for club management.

## How to Run This Repository

This repository contains code for a fitness class analysis project. You can run it either on Google Colab or locally on your machine.

### Running on Google Colab

1. **Accessing the Dataset**:
   - Download the dataset used in this project from [here](https://github.com/DavidCarG/FitnessClass/blob/main/DataSets/fitness_class.csv), if you haven't already.
   - Upload the dataset to your Google Drive. You can do this by visiting [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/) and uploading the file there.

2. **Open the Colab Notebook**:
   - Open the `fitness_class.ipynb` notebook on Google Colab. You can do this by clicking [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1S6k32Gh9VOYrKq-0IN1dS2jq2E82mtEp?usp=sharing).

3. **Mount Google Drive**:
   - In the Colab notebook, execute the following code to mount your Google Drive and access the dataset:

   ```python
   from google.colab import drive
   drive.mount('/content/drive')
   ```
   
##### Load the Dataset:

Modify the file path to your dataset to match the location in your Google Drive. Replace file_path with the correct path:

```python
import pandas as pd
file_path = '/content/drive/MyDrive/Datasets/fitness_class.csv'
fitness = pd.read_csv(file_path)
```

##### Run the Notebook:

Run the cells in the Colab notebook to analyze the fitness class data.

### Running Locally

##### Clone the Repository:

Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git
```
##### Install Dependencies:

Make sure you have the required Python packages installed by running:
